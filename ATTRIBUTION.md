## Original Project: GitHub Spec Kit

**IA MAX Kit** is a fork of [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), an innovative open-source toolkit for Specification-Driven Development (SDD).

### Original Authors and Maintainers

### What We Inherited

We are deeply grateful to the GitHub Spec Kit team for building such a solid foundation. From Spec Kit, we inherited:

1. **Core SDD Philosophy**: The revolutionary concept of specifications as executable artifacts
2. **Specify CLI**: The command-line interface for bootstrapping SDD projects
3. **Multi-Agent Support**: Out-of-the-box integration with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, and many others
4. **Template System**: Comprehensive templates for specifications, plans, tasks, and checklists
5. **Slash Commands**: The `/speckit.*` command system for AI agents
6. **Script Automation**: Bash and PowerShell scripts for feature management and context updates
7. **Constitution Framework**: Governance through the "Nine Articles of Development"
8. **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility

### What IA MAX Kit Adds

Building on this excellent foundation, IA MAX Kit extends the original with:

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents with clear roles (Dev, Reviewer, Refactor, Tester, Monitor, Resolver, Security, Docs)
2. **Repository Planning Graphs (RPG)**: Code context graphs for agent consistency and navigation
3. **Shared Memory Systems**: Namespace-based memory (consensus, whiteboard, persona) with pub/sub
4. **Deep Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration, structured logging, distributed tracing
5. **TEVV Framework**: Test, Evaluation, Verification & Validation (NIST AI RMF-inspired)
6. **SWE-Debate Mechanism**: Structured conflict resolution between agents
7. **AI-TDD Enhancements**: Type-constrained generation, ARCS-like retrieval, incremental parsing
8. **AI PR Package**: Automated compilation of test results, logs, and impact analysis
9. **Stack March**: Analytical questionnaire for technology stack selection based on NFRs
10. **IA MAX Templates**: Vision/scope, glossary, actors/use cases, ADRs, BDD features, memory, observability, TEVV, RPG

### Relationship to Original Project

**Fork Status**: This is an independent fork. While we started from GitHub Spec Kit, IA MAX Kit has evolved with significant additions focused on multi-agent AI development workflows.

**Compatibility**: IA MAX Kit maintains backward compatibility where possible. The `specify` CLI command is preserved, and original Spec Kit slash commands continue to work.

**Contributions**: We welcome contributions from the community. If you find improvements that could benefit the original Spec Kit project, please consider contributing them upstream at https://github.com/github/spec-kit.

IA MAX Kit is released under the same **MIT License** as the original GitHub Spec Kit, as required by the original license terms. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for full details.
